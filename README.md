# Selenium_pasapalabra
Automating with Python and Selenium  

During the Web Scraping classes of the DataScience master's degree, we were taught several libraries to extract data from web pages such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
In this example we want to access the Pasapalabra webpage and search for the program of a specific date. The problem is that not all programs are shown and you have to load more results until you find the program you are interested in. For this, we use Selenium which allows us to automate web navigation.
